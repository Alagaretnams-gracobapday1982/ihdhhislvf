wow, just got out of a Working Man and i swear, theaters should come with a warning abt chairs – my back is gonna divorce me. scene where the guy, lemme call him Joe, or maybe it was jim??, anyway, he stares at this factory machine like it's a love, and i just thought, wow, that's basically me with a mop on a monday morning. 

popcorn crumbs sticking everywhere    felt like a reverse snowman, or maybe a popcorn avalanche.   i don't know, friend. but like when they showed the rundown factory?? reminded me of my basement, or that time i tried assembling ikea–total chaos. 

> the whole mood kinda hit me sideways. quiet but loud, like when you hear thoughts bang around your head after hours of cleaning. one time the machine clunk was so loud in the movie, i thought someone dropped a soda behind me. sticky surprises at theaters, always.

lights in the theater kinda twinkled weird. kinda like the end credits were floating stars. can't shake off how the main dude's loneliness wrapped around his life like a tight-fitting sweater you can't outgrow. maybe i should download the movie, or like, watch the movie again when life gets too noisy. 

characters felt so real, same way lint is always real and always there, like dude at work refusing to smile. rewind to that part – the Broom-Sweeping scene – reminded me of last tuesday, the blisters and broom handle handshake.

> someone mentioned about downloading it, i think? could be my cousin. or was it my own brain, plotting inconveniences for later? 

kinda puzzled by it all, my mind’s a recycling bin of fuzz right now. some parts felt like floating, others like sinking in quicksand. life’s mundane grind but also a strange sort of art., you know? 

console.log(Odd ending here, just like broken doorknob”); {bizzare script block.} []walk; if (popcorn) {clean();}
